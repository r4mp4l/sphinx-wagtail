# Variables

### Version 23

# 1 Variables

## 1.1 Variable System

In dialogues definitions are made by entering fixed values. A lot of time it would be beneficial to be able
to manipulate such definitions 'from outside' or to specify values with dependency on other settings.
These requirements can be met by a system to define and use variables. Instead of giving a fixed value
to e.g. the height of a beam you enter a variable. This variable is entered in a central location e.g. in the
'default values' of a building file. This default value will now be entered in all dialogue boxes where the
variable has been used to define the height of a beam without having to open each box and make
manual adjustments. Other variables, such as the thickness of slices, are automatically provided by the
system.

▪ The 'System of Variables' is used in 'Default Values', 'SmartTags', 'Wall Guideline Editor' and 'Logic
Blocks'.

▪ In every editor it is possible to define the specifications of variables in the **variable definition
dialog**. Once the user is prompted to specify default values or a Smart Tag or Logic Block is
positioned, the user will be prompted to enter or edit the values of the defined variables. The dialog
box is the **user variable prompt**.

**1.1.1 User Variables**

▪ ▪The variable that can be defined by the user are called **User Variables**. There are also variables that
provide values and information about objects and building parts. These are called **system variables
(SV)** , they are hard wired in the system and cannot be edited or defined.

▪ The UV can be freely defined.

```
▪ The variable name has to start with a capital 'V', as to set them apart from the SV. The naming
makes UV easy to recognize and handle. e.g. 'VdBm' as Variable depth Bird's mouth
▪ Variable names are alpha numeric and may be structured with underscores. Spaces, Operations (+,
```
- , *, /), punctuation, brackets or other special characters are not allowed.
▪ ▪Names are case sensitive; **Vab** is different from VAB. It is not advisable to use upper and lower
case to keep different variable names apart.

▪ Variables can be arranged in groups. If there are more than one group in a variable prompt, they will
be shown in separate sub sections. Each sub section can be opened by clicking the respective button.
Each variable group automatically generates a button in the dialogue box.

▪ You can add descriptive text and help pictures to each variable. The text and picture show up in the
variable prompt and when you insert a variable in a function or calculation.

▪ Sets of variables can be saved and managed with the usual routine. A variable set contains definitions
of a number of variables. A set of variables can be saved and reused for other purposes. Sets of
variables can be shared with other users via 'data exchange', e-mail attachment etc. When you load a
variable set you have a choice of replacing existing variables or just adding new ones.

**1.1.2 Dietrich's Default Variables**

Dietrich's provides a comprehensive set definitions based on user defined variables. This is the Dietrich's
default set of user variables. Like user variables, they can be edited freely. To avoid naming conflicts and
overwriting of variables please observe the following rules:

1) Dietrich's default variables also start with V followed by an underscore 'V_'. Avoid naming your own
user variables using 'V_' and you will not run into conflicts with the default set.

2) You are free to use Dietrich's default variables in prompts and settings. Doing that, please don't
change the intention of the variable itself.


1.1.2.1 Dietrich's Default Values

Together with the update we provide a comprehensive and coherent collection of default values and
prepared settings for the program modules Roof, Wall, Ceiling, Truss and the related processes. The
default values used are called 'Dietrich's Default Values'. They are based on the 'Dietrich's Default
Variables' mentioned above.

In order for the prepared settings to work properly, the 'Dietrich's Default Values' have to be available. If
you load the under 1-6 Default values, you can use them and change the values. If you don't include all
variables, some values are not available and some settings might not work. In order to have all settings
with working reasonable values, the missing variables will be made available from a separate list. In the
formula editor, you will find this list in the tree element under 'Dietrich's Default Values'. The default
values you specify under 1-6 Default Values are in the list of 'User Defined Variables'.

**1.1.3 System Variables**

System variables offer values that come from the system directly. They make information about building
parts and objects available for use in calculations, conditions and functions, e.g. slice thicknesses, point
coordinates, etc.

System variables are available through the formula editor. They come with description text and help
pictures.

**1.1.4 Ranking of Variables**

▪ Generally, the variable system is continuous over all levels. A variable that has been defined on a
project level can be used in positions, SmartTags, Logic Blocks and wall guidelines.

▪ Variables that serve as default values will be linked through to the next level, always keeping the
value that has been defined last:
▪ E.g. you define a post width of 0,06m on a project level. Each file within this project can access this
variable and all posts will be generated with a width of 0,06m. If the default values of one building
file (position level) of this project redefines the same variable with a post width of 0,08m the posts
in this file will be 0,08m wide, whereas the post width in all other files will remain 0,06m.
▪ A wall guideline that is applied in the same building file will also use the 0,08m post width. If the
variable is defined inside the wall guideline with a width of 0,10m the guideline will use this value
in the same building file.

▪ The tag 'external' will reverse this ranking.

```
▪ E.g. the variable for post width is defined with 0,06m on a building file level; the 'external' tag is
set. All posts generated in the building file will be 0,06m wide. If the same variable is defined on
project level (one level up) with 0,12m, the posts generated in the building file will be 0,12m wide.
The external value coming from project level will have higher priority than the value on position
level.
▪ The same variable used in a wall guideline with the 'external' flag set will now also generate 0,12m
wide posts coming from the building file or directly from project level.
▪ Externally defined variables can be used to initiate a value for a variable. The variable will receive
this value if not otherwise defined on a higher level. Like this you can make sure that the variable
in e.g. a wall guideline has a value, even if it has not been defined for the building file or project
level.
```
## 1.2 Definition of Variables

**1.2.1 Variable Definition, Properties of Variables**

Variables can be edited in the variable list or the variable definition dialog box. In the list you can quickly
define variables, edit values and sort them. The dialog offers a more elaborate definition of variables.
The following describes the columns of the list of variables; the further explanations describe functions to
be found in the variable definition dialog.

▪ Using the dialog box is recommended to add description text and to enter a list of possible values for
an 'ENUM' type variable (enumeration = list)


▪ The sequence of appearance inside the variable list can be changed by moving variables up or down.
Un-used variables can be deleted; new ones can be added any time. See the buttons on the right
hand side under the list.

Column F / Fixed Value:
If this box is ticked, the variable cannot be changed in the user prompt (14.03) (In former
versions the variable was not even visible in this case). Fixed values are used to define values
the designer of the LB might want to change later on, but should not be open to the general
user.

Column E / External:
This tag reverses the priority that defines the value of the variable: If the variable is defined
on a higher level this value will be used instead.

```
Example: The same variable is defined in a building file and in a Logic Block. Normally, the
Logic Block would use the value given inside the Logic Block. Now we define the variable to
receive its value externally:
▪ If the variable exists in the building file, its value will now be used in the Logic Block. The
variable prompt of the Logic Block will show the variable with the value coming from the
building file. The value can be erased.
```
```
▪ If the value for the variable is taken from external, the input field is green. If the
external value is altered, the change is adopted in the field.
▪ If you overwrite the default value, the input field becomes red. The manually entered
value is kept also if you change the default value.
▪ If you highlight the manually entered value and delete it with "DEL", the default value
appears again and the field is highlighted with green color.
▪ If the variable does not exist in the building file, the value from inside the Logic Block will
be used. The variable prompt of the Logic Block will show the variable with the value
coming from the Logic Block. Its value can be edited.
▪ If the variable should not appear in the prompt, you can put a check mark in the H-
column. (In former versions, the column F (fixed value) was used in this case).
If you want to use a variable in a Logic Block, Smart Tag or wall guideline, you have to define
it there in order to make it appear in the formula editor.
```
Column H / Hidden (14.03)
By default, all variables are represented at input now, no matter if they are "fixed values" or
"external". If you do not want a variable to be represented at input, check the box
"H"(hidden).
Existing definitions of fixed values from older version are automatically set to "invisible" so
that the behavior is the same as before.

Column Variable/ Variable Name:
Name of the variable to be used in functions and calculations. The browser button next to the
name can be used to load variable sets. You can select a single variable from any variable set
and add it to the list.

Column Variable Prompt / Variable Prompt:
This is the text that will show up in the 'variable prompt' dialog box when the LB is inserted.
The user will be asked to enter a value according to this description. In the formula editor this
text will also appear as a short description of the variable.

Column Default Value / Default Value:
This is the initial value of the variable, the first time the user prompt appears. Once a value is
changed the dialog box will remember the last settings used. With the button 'Default Values'
they can be reset to the initial values.

Column Unit / Unit:
This defines the unit of the variable value. The unit controls the available options of the user
prompt and show browser buttons etc. Available units see further down.

Picture / Help Picture:
The selected picture is shown in the user prompt for this variable. The help picture should


```
assist the user in entering the correct information. Most of the time a picture explains more
that words ever will. The picture will also assist the designer of the LB or someone who will
try and adjust it for their purposes. The last help picture will also be shown for the next
variables unless they have their own picture attached.
For more information on help pictures refer to the respective section.
```
Variable Group:
Variable can be organized in groups. The groups will structure the visual appearance in the
variable prompt dialogue and in the selection dialogues of the formula editor. If no group is
specified, the variable belongs to the group 'general'.
In variable definition, specific groups of variables can be accessed by the group buttons. The
list of variables remains visible; the variables of the current group are shown in blue, the
other groups are shown in grey. The list will jump to the first variable of the selected group.
All variables remain editable.
If there is more than one group in a variable prompt, they will be shown in separate sub
sections. Each sub section can be opened by clicking the respective button. Each variable
group automatically generates a button in the dialogue box.

Variable Display:
In den mehrzeiligen Texten der Planelemente können Variablen eingefügt werden. Intern wird
der Variablenname gespeichert, der jedoch für das Lesen teils ungeeignet ist. Wird der Text
editiert, wird für die Variable die Variablenanzeige angezeigt, wenn sie vorhanden ist.
Beispiel: Für die Eingabe des Lieferdatums in den Vorgabewerten wird die Variable **V_LDat**
verwendet. Definiert man die Variablenanzeige als **Lieferdatum** , so wird beim Editieren des
Textes die Variable als **#Lieferdatum#** (und nicht als **#V_LDat#** ) angezeigt.

Variable Condition:
(V20.02) The variable condition can be used to hide variables in the variable query of building
default values and logic blocks. The queries can therefore be adapted to the input situation.
This is used to e.g. query only certain variables in a window in an input situation A
(architecture), additional variables in the input situation C (construction). For control
purposes, the standard variable **V_VarSit** is set in the default values of the project or the
building position and queried in the variable conditions.
▪ **V_VarSit** must be set before calling the logic block, i.e. in the default values of the project
or the structure position. To use it in the building default values, it must also be set
beforehand, i.e. in the project default values.
▪ **V_VarSit** should preferably be an enum with, for example, the values
**A: Architectur; C: Construction; X: Administrator**.

```
▪ In the conditions, it is advisable to query the values with wildcards so that texts can also
be adjusted in the default values. The condition (V_VarSit = {A *}) works for the term
Architecture as well as for Architectural design as well as A: Design department
etc.
▪ For a variable that is only to be queried in the architecture situation (planning phase), the
condition is then: (V_VarSit={A*}).
```
```
▪ For a variable that is only to be queried in the situations (planning phase) architecture and
construction, the condition is then: (V_VarSit={A*~c*}).
```
```
Variables with the identifier I (invisible) are never queried; the condition is only effective for
variables for which I is not set.
If the variable V_VarSit was not set in the default values, then all conditions would be false
and no conditional variables would be displayed. In this case, the system sets the V_VarSit
variable to "_" (an underscore). This can be used as follows:
▪ The variable is placed at the beginning of the variable queries for building default values
and logic blocks V_VarSit_NotExist.
```
. It gets the variable condition: **(V_VarSit=_)** , only appears in this case.
. The following text can be used to query the variables: **The input situation is not**
    **defined!**.


. **%DHPABB%\DVARSITX.bmp** should be used here as an auxiliary image, which provides
    corresponding information.
▪ So that all conditional variables are displayed in the case of **V_VarSit = _,** it is
recommended to include the underscore in the selection. For a variable that should
normally only be queried in the architecture input situation, the condition is then:
**(V_VarSit = {A * ~ _}** ). For a variable that should only be queried in the architecture
and construction input situations, the condition is then: **(V_VarSit = {A * ~ C * ~
_}).**

```
Input situation V_Varsit in the current dialog: The variable condition in a dialog (example
default values building) is usually controlled by the value of V_Varsit that was set externally
(example default values project). If V_Varsit is now also set in the current dialog, this value
applies because the variables are read in first and then the display is set up. If you now
change the value of V_Varsit in the dialog (i.e. in the default values for the building), this
change only takes effect the next time the dialog is called. V_Varsit is created in the variable
logic blocks so that it can be used in the formula editor. So that the value is taken over from
the outside, you simply have to set V_Varsit to external.
```
Further Values:
This list is only available for ENUM type variables. Here you can specify the options that will
appear in a drop down list in the variable prompt. In the variable definition dialog there is one
value per line. The first value of the list automatically is the default. In the variable list the
values can be written into the 'default value' column, separated by semi colons.

Variable Description:
Additional explanatory text for each variable. This text will show up in the variable prompt
and in the formula editor when you pick a variable.

**1.2.2 Available Variable Units:**

Separator In the user prompt the text in column variable prompt will appear as a headline for the next
section. The user cannot enter a value here. A default value has to be defined but is
irrelevant (e.g. enter '0').

Number Numeric value. Integer. This can be used e.g. to specify a number of elements.

m, cm, mm, in, ft: length units. Meter, centimeter, millimeter, inches, feet-inches

° Angle in degrees. 306° full circle

A-B Reference faces of objects A or B. A origin, B end. They can only be used in Smart Tags.

C-F Reference faces of objects C through F (length faces without origin and end). They can only
be used in Smart Tags.

A-F Reference faces of objects A through F (length faces, origin and end). They can only be used
in Smart Tags.

txt Text

Y/N Yes/No: They can only be used in Smart Tags.

Enum Enumeration: List of texts the user can select from. The user prompt will offer a drop down
list and the user can select from a fixed list of options. The first value of the list automatically
is the default. Use the variable definition dialog box to easily enter the list items. Enum are
used a lot to define conditions, but they can also be used in texts.


Item#fixt Item number of fixtures. In the user prompt a browser button allows to access the material
dbase. The dbase will only show fixture objects. This unit is used in Smart Tags primarily.

Item#Np Item number, no profile. In the user prompt a browser button allows to access the material
dbase. The dbase will only show object types beam, sheet material, mold, auxiliary that do
not have a profile description attached. This unit is used to give 3D library objects a new
item#. Since the library objects can have any shape and form it does not make sense to give
them an item# of an object with a fixed section profile.

Item#Obj Item number for objects. In the user prompt a browser button allows to access the material
dbase. The dbase will show object types beam, sheet material, mold, auxiliary. This unit is
used to give objects that are created by the LB an item# and if required a profile description,
to enter I-beams etc.

BeamT Beam type. It can only be used in Smart Tags.

S/C Deliver to Shop or Construction site. It can only be used in Smart Tags.

Texture SetTexture set for objects or 3D library objects. In the user prompt a browser button allows to
access to the texture sets.

ColTexture Additional color for texture sets. This color will be mixed with the texture set of objects. In
the user prompt a browser button allows to access to the color selection.

**1.2.3 Variables: Help Pictures**

Help pictures are used to assist users in entering values for variables.

▪ ▪Possible file formats are: ***.bmp, *.png, *.wmf, *.emf, *.jpg**.

▪ Default size of help pictures is 340x340 pixel (used to be 300x300). If the image file is bigger than
that, it will automatically shrink to fit. To save memory, bigger images (e.g. photos) should be edited
with appropriate software tools (e.g. [http://www.irfanview.net/](http://www.irfanview.net/) , [http://www.getpaint.net/,](http://www.getpaint.net/,)
[http://www.gimp.org/](http://www.gimp.org/) ) to reduce size and number of colors.

▪ Dietrich's provides a comprehensive set of help pictures for different applications. They can be found
in the system directory for help pictures **%dhpabb%** , e.g. C:\Dietrichs12\abb. These pictures are
generally available for all users with a current release version. If you share files using these pictures,
you don't have to share the linked images as well. That's why variable sets and default value
definitions only contain links to images, not the images themselves.

▪ If a saved set of variables contains links to images in %dhpabb% only the reference links will be
saved. If you link to images from a different location, the image will be saved in-line with the
variables. If you share your definitions all images will be included either as references or in-line.

▪ SmartTags only save references to images. If you share a LogicBlock you will also have to include the
images that have not been taken from **%dhpabb%**

▪ Logic Blocks only save references to images. If you share a LogicBlock you will also have to include
the images that have not been taken from **%dhpabb%**

▪ Wall guidelines save all help images in-line. If you share your wall guidelines all images will be
included either as references or in-line.

▪ ▪If a default values of projects, building files and roof profiles contain links to images in **%dhpabb%** only
the reference links will be saved. If you link to images from a different location, the image will be
saved in-line with the default values. If you share a project or individual files, all images will be
included either as references or in-line.

**1.2.4 Saving Variables in Variable Sets**

▪ Sets of variables can be saved and managed with the usual routine. You can load entire sets or
individual variables in a variable definition.

Single variables can be loaded by clicking the browser button next to the variable name. Entire sets of
variables can be loaded by selecting the set in the pull down list at the top of the dialogue box.


▪ By loading saved variable you can make sure that you are always using the same variable for the
same purpose.

▪ Descriptive text and help pictures are automatically defined appropriately.

▪ You can use saved variables in default values, SmartTags, Logic Blocks and wall guidelines alike. They
can be used as default values on project level, building files and roof profiles.

▪ If you load an entire set, you have a choice of:

- adding new variables only,
- overwriting existing ones and adding new ones
- clearing all variables and loading the entire set.

**1.2.5 Auxiliary functions for entering variables**

1.2.5.1 Variable Search

(V20.01) When creating and editing formulas, it often happens that you have to look for the definition of
the variable or colculations. In all dialogs for the definition of variables and calculations (default values,
smart tags, logic blocks, HRB Editor) there is now a function to search for variables or calculations. This
is called up via the corresponding button and the search term is entered:

▪ The exact text (e.g. **V_abc123** ) or with wildcards the text part, e.g. **V_A *** for all variables that begin
with **V_A, * abc *** for all that contain abc.

▪ The function searches both in the variable names and in the variable query. You can also search for
the text displayed if you do not know the variable name.

▪ If you start the function again and enter a new search text, the search starts automatically at the
beginning of the variable list.

▪ With the button "continue" the most recently used search text is searched for and the user jumps
from the current position to the next position that contains the text.

1.2.5.2 Variable Editor file

(V20.01) Variable Editor file: For editing calculations, it has proven useful to be able to store them in a
text file and edit them with a conventional text editor. There are many helpful functions such as
searching, replacing, copying etc. available. Now, in all dialogs for variable definition (default values,
samrt tags, logic blocks and HRB editor), the variables can also be swapped out and put back into a text
file. The files are located as for the calculations in **%DHPTMP%** (z.B. **C:\Dietrichs19\wintmp** ) ans the
filenames are **VAEditor.txt** bzw. **VAEditorHRB.txt**.

1.2.5.3 log-files for variables and calculations

When executing logic blocks and when working with wal guidelines we can generate log files. These
contain a list of the variables and calculations with the corresponding values in the respective situation.
The log files are created in the **%DHPTMP%** directory (for example, **c:\Dietrichs20\wintmp** ). They are
extremely helpful for the control, but these files are not necessary for the application of logic blocks and
wall guidelines The generation is controlled in the project administration in the function " _5 - 02 - 1 Log
functions_ " via the checkbox " _Create log files for variables_ ". If it is set, the log files are generated. By
default, the checkbox is not set, the files are not created. This saves time in the process.

# 2 Formulas and Text

## 2.1 Formulas

Functions that can be used in calculations:


+ - * / Mathematical operations

() Brackets

sin, cos, tan Angle functions. Sin, cousin, tangent. Angle in degrees (0-360°)

asin, acos, atan Angle functions. Arcus sinus, arcus cosinus, arcus tangens. To determine an angle
from the relationship between 2 sides of a triangle. (Result in degrees 0-360°)

sqrt Square root ( sqrt(25) = 5)

^ Powers. (5^2 = 25)

Pi Math constant Pi (approx. 3.14159). Circumference of a circle with a diameter of 2.5 =
2.5*Pi. etc.

round Rounding of numerical value. The rounding mode is round half up (e.g. round(2.4) = 2;
round(2.5)=3) If you want to round up you have to add 0.5 to the value. (e.g.
round(VAB+0.5); VAB=2,4 -> round(2.4+0.5) = 3 Important function to calculate
distributions.

abs Absolute value. Turns positive and negative values into positive values only. abs(25) is
25, abs(-25) is 25. Important function to calculate distances between points independent
of the sequence they are selected in.

2.1.1.1 Formula editor

The formula editor shows a list of variables in the bottom left corner that are used in a formula. Behind
the variable names is description text. If you select a variable, it will open in the tree element next to it
and where applicable, a help picture will be displayed. The content of the formula will become more
transparent.

(V20.01) HRB-Editor: Display of current values in the formula editor: If a formula is opened in the
formula editor, the current values of the variables are also displayed in the variable list after the texts.
At the top of the dialog you can see the result of the whole formula. These displays are very helpful in
checking the formulas; it is easier to see whether it is due to the current formula or whether there is an
unexpected value for a variable. The values can only be displayed in the HRB editor, since only here are
the system variables assigned.

2.1.1.2 All variables available in the formula editor

(15.01) Conditions can be defined for all types of formula. In conditions, not only numeric values can be
used. It is possible to use all types of variables, e.g. texts. Therefore, not only variables for numeric
values are offered in the formula editor, but all types of variables.

**2.1.2 Formulas with conditions, conditions**

Formulas may contain conditions. With conditions you can define formulas that will react differently in
certain situations. E.g. this should reduce the number of required SmartTags dramatically.

A formula with condition consists of three parts, which are separated by semicolons:

**(IF);(THEN);(ELSE)**

(14.03) Conditions can be interlaced, in order to cover more than 2 situations within one formula.

Examples:

**(condition 1);((condition 2);(2 true);(2 false));(1 un true)
(** --------------- _1 true------------------------_ **)**

**(condition 1);(1 true);((condition 2);(2 true);(2 false))
(** - ------------- _1 false-----------_ **)**

The interlacing can be continued in 'true' and 'false' at the same time.


On the next level, the interlacing of conditions can go on. Example:

**(con. 1);(1 erf.);((con. 2);(2 true.);((con. 3);(3 true.);(3 false.)))
(** --------- _1 false----------------------------------_ **)
(** --------- _2 false--------------_ **)**

2.1.2.1 Comparisons, that can be used in LBs:

= Equal to. True if compared values are equal. E.g.: VAB = 4 is true if VAB is exactly 4

!= Not equal to. True if compared values are not equal. It does not say that one is greater than the
other, or even that they can be compared in size.
e.g.: VAB != 4 is true if VAB is less or greater than 4.

> Greater than. True if the value in front of the sign is greater than the other. These relations are
known as strict inequalities.
e.g.: VAB>4 is true if VAB is bigger than 4

>= Greater than or equal to. True if value in front of the sign is greater than or equal to the other.
e.g.: VAB>=4 is true if VAB is greater than or equal to 4

< Less than. True if the value in front of the sign is less than the other. These relations are known as
strict inequalities.
e.g.: VAB<4 is true if VAB is less than 4

<= Less than or equal to. True if value in front of the sign is less than or equal to the other.
e.g.: VAB<=4 is true if VAB is less than or equal to 4

& AND. Multiple conditions can be linked with &. All linked comparisons have to be true to make the
entire inequality true.
e.g. (VAB>4)&(VAB<8)

2.1.2.2 Linked conditions, logical links

Several conditions can be logically linked:

& logic **and**. All conditions associated with **and** must be met. So if VAB must be greater than 4 and
less than 8, the whole expression is:

(VAB> 4) & (VAB <8)

| logic **or**. (V20.01) At least one of the conditions must be met:

. As an **or** character (as in C ++) the | used. You get this on the keyboard with AltGr + "<".
. We use the normal **or** here: If at least one of the two sub-conditions is met, the whole **or**
    expression is met. Both partial conditions may also be met. (with the exclusive **or** only one of
    the two should be met).

The logical links and **and** or **or** can also be used in combination. Here are examples of conditional
formulas:

Example: **((V_abc=a)|(V_abc=b));(0.04);(0.16)**

If the variable V_abc has the value a **or** b, the value is 0.04. In all other cases the value is 0.16.

Example: **((V_aa=a)|(V_bb=b));(0.04);(0.16)**

If the variable V_aa has the value a **or** V_bb the value b, then the value is 0.04. The overall condition is
also met if both parts apply (V_aa = a and V_bb = b). In all other cases the value is 0.16.

Example: **V_a1=0)&(V_a2!=0))|((V_a1!=0)&(V_a2=0)));(0.04);(0.16)**

Only one of the variables V_a1 and V_a2 may have the value 0, then the value is 0.04. In all other cases
the value is 0.16.

2.1.2.3 Possibilities of nesting conditions

In conditional formulas, the conditions can be very nested, e.g.:

```
(((V_a1=0)&(V_a2!=0))|((V_a1!=0)&(V_a2=0)));(0.04);(0.16)
```

In conditional formulas, the conditions can also contain formulas, for example:

```
(V_a1=(1+2+V_a2));(0.04);(0.16)
```
In conditional formulas, complete conditional formulas can also be placed in the true/false parts (after
the first or second semicolon) and thus be further nested, e.g.:

```
(V_a1=0);((V_a2=0);(0.04);(0.16));(0.16)
```
However, no complete conditional formula may be used within a condition.

So the following is not allowed:

```
(0.3<((0.4<0.5);(0.6);(0.1));(0.04);(0.10)
```
As said above, conditions may be nested arbitrarily and the individual parts (left and right of the
comparison sign) may also contain formulas. But the condition must not contain a complete conditional
formula. So no semicolons may appear there.

Logically, these cases can be covered by rearranging the formula or, for a better overview, can be
broken down into several calculations.

2.1.2.4 Tolerances in comparisons:

If you compare calculated values, you have to observe, that internally numbers are handled with a lot of
decimal places. Instead of 1.0 the result of a calculation could be 0.99999999999 or 1.00000000001. If
you compare for equality now (VA=1), the result may be false, even though technically the result should
be true.

▪ You can compare 2 values within a given tolerance range. To do that you compare the difference to
the desired value: e.g. VA = 1.0 shall be true within a range of +/- 0.01. The difference has to be
between -0.01 and +0.01. The condition can be defined as
((0.01>(VA - 1.0))&(-0.01<(VA - 1.0)))
To eliminate the negative part you can also use the function 'abs' for an absolute value
(0.01>(abs(VA - 1.0)))

▪ In other cases it might be enough to compare a value with a safe enough number. E.g. in a
distribution function you would normally calculate the number of pieces (VNumP). If the condition is
now, that there should be more than 3 pieces, you don't compare with greater than 3, but with
greater than 2.5 (VNumP>2.5). By doing that it does not matter if VNumP is 2.99999 or 3.00001.

2.1.2.5 Texts in coditonal formulas

(21.01) This chapter from version 18.01 has been completely deleted.

2.1.2.6 Comparing texts:

Texts can be used for comparisons as well. Basically, you can use variables with all units that contain no
numerical value: txt, Idnr., Enum, A-F, ...

The comparison value is written directly as a text without additional tags. Example: If the variable
' **V_Textvariable** ' is supposed to be equal ' _Test_ ', the comparison is: **(V_Textvariable=Test)**

Texts are sorted alphabetically. So they can also be compared with '>' and '<'. Texts coming first in the
sorting are 'smaller' than texts coming last in the sorting: So ' **Aluminum** ' is ' _smaller_ ' than ' **Brick** '.

If the condition is, that teh variable contains empty text, the value of the variable has to bigger ' '
(space character) **(V_Textvariable> )**. There is no formula for empty text, so we have to compare with
the smallest possible value. The ' ' (space character) is one of the first characters in the fonts. Only the
control characters are on top. We have to use one of the characters before ' **#** ', because item numbers
begin with ' **#** '.


2.1.2.7 Texts in conditions: Special case oa1 file (IFC Premium)

In the conditions of the oa1 files, comparisons are made with system variables. Dabei ist folgendes zu
beachten:

```
If the system variable is a number, it is written directly; Example:
Condition=(OH=1.23)
If it is a text that starts with a number (only then), it must be written in quotes. Example:
Condition=(IFCNAME="1.23")
```
2.1.2.8 Lists and wild cards in conditions

To now, it was only possible to compare with one single value in the conditions. The new possibility of
interrogating the storey (SWAKT) or the property (AUSF) leads us to using lists and wild cards.

Lists: If a condition is only valid for GF, type (SWAKT=GF). If it is valid for GF, IF and TF, type
(SWAKT= **{GF~UF~AG})**. The list is put into curly brackets, use tilde '~' as a separator.

Wild card: If a condition is valid only for the property "E Stick Frame R13", type ( **AUSF=E Stick Frame
R13)**. If it is valid for all properties starting with "E", type ( **AUSF={E*})**. The expression is put into curly
brackets. Use asterisk '*' as a wild card. The following arrangements can be used:

```
ABC* Starts with ABC , arbitrary end
```
```
*ABC Starts arbitrarily, ends on ABC
```
```
*ABC* Contains ABC at any position
```
Listings and wildcards: Both possibilities can be combined as well. If it is valid for all properties starting
with 'E' or 'I', type **(AUSF={E*~I*}** ).

**2.1.3 Arrays in formulas**

Only Logic Blocks: Where you define coordinates in order to position objects, library items and reference
points of SmartTags, you can define arrays.

▪ In every coordinate field you can enter an array as follows ( **ORIGIN~SPACING~QUANTITY** ). A quantity of

```
1 means, you get only 1 object in origin.
```
▪ If you specify an array, you have to do so in X, Y and Z.

```
X(1.0~0.1~5)Y(0.0~0.0~1)Z(0.0~0.0~1) Row along X with 5 objects, origin at 1.0 step size 0.
```
```
X(1.0~0.1~5)Y(0.0~0.2~4)Z(0.0~0.0~1) Row along X with 5 objects, origin at 1.0 step size 0.1,
this row 4 times along Y step size 0.2.
```
▪ With arrays, you can define rows, grids and 3 dimensional grids in one go.

**2.1.4 Error message, reporting incorrect formulas**

(V20.01) With the introduction of the new formula system, the error messages have also been revised:

▪ The display of formula errors has been expanded:

```
▫ Formulas are checked when files are opened (HRB, logic blocks, settings). If desired, the
corresponding checkbox is set beforehand in the project administration in function 5- 02 - 1 log
functions. The building must be restarted to take this into account.
▫ As far as possible, the type of formula error and the affected formula are displayed. This message
can be copied to the clipboard and then used in the search function of editors.
▫ The display of further errors can be prevented by pressing the button in the message. This applies
until the building (or HRB editor) is restarted. However, the error message of a division by 0 cannot
be prevented.
```

## 2.2 Variables in Text, Item Numbers

Text is used in dimensions, texts and labels. In those cases, text can be entered directly or via variables.

▪ In texts it is possible to mix any number of text strings and variables. In order to use a variable in
text the variable name has to be between '#' signs. Z.B.
**''Length: #VL[m,3]#, Width: #VW[cm,1]#, Height: #VH[cm,1]'**

▪ You can ask the user to enter text in the variable prompt for ' **txt** ' and **Enum** variables.

```
▪ Variables with item# or Beam Type are also text strings and can be used in text.
▪ Numeric values can be used in text. You have to define the format they should appear in. (see
below)
▪ In addition to that it is possible to add the values of system variables.
```
▪ Formatting of numeric values in text:

```
▪ In order to show numeric values in different units and decimal places the unit and precision info is
added to the Variable name in square brackets. e.g.: #V23[cm, 1]# will show the value of 'V23' in
centimeter and 1 decimal place.
▪ For the units m (meter), cm (centimeter), mm (millimeter) and in (inches) you define the number
of decimal places. For the unit ft (feet) you define the fraction you want to show. e.g. #VL[ft,16]#
will show the value of VL in feet-inches and 16th (10'-0 3/16")
▪ ▪The unit of angles is '°' e.g. #Valpha[°,1]# is 45,3°
```
```
▪ For numeric values that are neither lengths nor angles you don't have to specify a unit, but you
have to add the comma and number of decimals. e.g. #VNumP[,1]# .; #VNumP[,0]# number of
pieces no decimals (3).
(V20.02) There is an additional formatting option for the output of variables in texts. For this
purpose, a filler character and the total number of characters are added after the decimal places.
```
```
 Example variable V _Num=34.34676. The formatting #V_Num[m,2] # outputs in m with rounding
to 2 decimal places: 34.35. Now you can extend the formatting to #V_Zahl[m,2,x,8]#; this fills
the text with x to a total of 8 digits: xxx34.35. The decimal separator also counts as one digit.
```
```
If you do not need fill characters, the formatting can still be written with units and decimal
places: #V_Num[m,2]#.
```
```
 If a text variable is formatted longer, no unit or rounding is required. For the variable V_Text =
abcde , the formatting #V_Text[,,-,8]# fills the text with - to a total of 8 characters: ---abcde.
The first two commas must be specified in the formatting, even if there is no unit and rounding.
 This formatting is used e.g. for right-aligned lists or for the formation of file names.
```
In the same way, text variables can be used to carry item numbers. Using text and variables you can put
together an item# that can be used for 3D library objects and objects. This can be used to add a size to
an item number. E.g. you want to compare an item# with the text **'rod'** and the diameter 'Vdia' in full
mm. The expression for the item# would be 'rod#Vdia[mm,0]#'.

You can also use the calculations to compose text and have the result in a variable. In calculations you
also have the option to compose text differently depending on conditions that you define. For further
information refer to the chapter: 'Logic blocks - calculations'

**2.2.1 Special rules in formulas for caltculations of type text**

If a calculation has the type Text (unit txt), you can directly assign plaintext, all kinds of variables or
both mixed, and enter it in the formula. There are the following rules to consider:

```
▪ If the calculation should directly take on the value of a variable of type text, then this variable can
be written directly into the formula without special characters. If the calculation V_ZW_Text1 should
get the value oft he variable V_Var_Text , sthe formula is simply: V_Var_Text
```

```
Attention: The program first checks whether the whole text of the formula matches the name of a
variable (system variables, user variables, calculations). Ist dies der Fall, so wird der Text
bevorzugt als Variable interpretiert und ihr Wert übernommen.
So you can not directly assign the text V_Var_Text in our case; it would be replaced by the content
of the variable. The same applies to system variables: If a formula consists only of the word SWAKT ,
this word will always be replaced by the content of the system variable SWAKT (current storey).
```
```
If the text, which consists only of the name of a variable (system variables, user variables,
calculations), is needed, a character must be prefixed or appended. The space can also be set
ahead. Operators (- + * / ~ <> = etc.) are not allowed here. For our examples would be possible
e.g.: _SWAKT or SWAKT_.
```
```
▪ If variables (system variables, user variables, calculations) are combined with plain text, the
variable names must be enclosed in #: plain text #SWAKT#
```
```
▪ (17.01) These rules also apply to formulas that are part of a conditional formula.
(18.01) It should be noted here that plaintext in conditional formulas must always be written in
apostrophes.
Example: The value of SWAKT is GF.
```
```
The conditional formula ( condition );(#SWAKT#);(SWAKT) results:
```
```
Condition met: GF (#SWAKT# is replaced by value)
```
```
Condition not met: GF (SWAKT is recognized as a variable because it stands
alone, so it is also replaced by value)
The conditional formula ( condition );("Klartext" #SWAKT#);("Klartext" SWAKT) results
```
```
Condition met: Klartext GF (#SWAKT# is replaced by value)
```
```
Condition not met: Klartext SWAKT (SWAKT is recognized as a variable because it stands
alone)
```
2.2.1.1 Conditional formulas for calculations of type text (unit txt)

(21.01) For calculations of type decimal (unit m) conditions may contain mathematical formulas as well
as text comparisons. However, the formulas of intermediate values of type text (unit txt) are treated
completely as texts only; thus, conditions are performed with text comparison. Conditions for
intermediate calculations of type text may not contain mathematical formulas.

```
Example of a calculations of type text:
The following conditional formula is possible, because the condition compares texts: The
name of the execution must contain AW, then C24 is taken, otherwise KVH-Si:
Possible formula: (AUSF={AW*});(C24);(KVH-Si)
```
```
The following conditional formula is not possible because the condition contains mathematical
formulas. The program would recognize the variable V_width and compare its value with the
text "2.0" after alphabetical sorting: And this has confusing results:
Faulty formula: (V_Width>2.0));(C24);(KVH-Si)
```
```
Attention! If V_width has the value 3.00, then the texts "3.00" and "2.00" would be
compared and the result C24 looks correct. Because the 3 comes more alphabetically
after the 2 and is thus larger. However, if V_width has the value 10.00, the result is
KVH-Si. The "10.00" is therefore not larger than "2.00", since the 1 comes
alphabetically before the 2 and is therefore smaller.
```
Recommendation for conditions for calculations of type text (unit txt):

If you want to condition calculations of text type (txt unit) with mathematical formulas, you must enter
them in the Variable condition field. Then the conditions are not in a conditional formula, but
independent conditions and are analyzed accordingly. Mathematical formulas as well as text comparisons
are possible here.


# 3 Editable settings files

(18.02) Some functions of the program require editable settings that are not to burden the dialogues and
are particularly effective to edit in a conventional text editor. For this purpose, the editable settings files
were introduced. Examples of the application:

```
▪ Project administration: new project – from IFC
▪ Free design 1 - 4 - 9 Check building
▪ Wall design 1 - 4 - 2 Center of gravity, auto. mounting
(Editable setting only available via special module)
▪ Floor plan, floor decks and roof calculation: 1 - 8 - 5 sheating – enter designation
(Editable setting only available via special module)
```
All these files are structured according to the same rules and can be edited accordingly. The uniformity
ensures the most effective workability of the files.

There are 2 ways to edit the contents of these files:

- In special dialogue for these files: _Change settings_ for editable settings files
- or in a general text editor, e.g. Notepad.
In any case, incorrect entries are possible that can not be intercepted by the program. **Therefore,
only savvy users should edit these files.**

For these files, the benefits of " _manage settings_ " to data exchange can be used.

## 3.1 Select and manage settings for editable settings files

In dialogs with access to editable settings files, there is an item from _select settings_ and _change settings_ :

**3.1.1 Settings Selection for editable settings files**

Several settings can be stored in the settings file. By clicking in the element _select settings_ a tree
element with the available settings and the option no _settings opens_. Here you can quickly switch
between the settings.

**3.1.2 Change settings for editable settings files**

When changing settings, a dialog for editing the editable settings files is called up. This allows a
comfortable and yet free editing of the files:

```
The header of the dialog shows the path and file name of the edited file. So you can find the file
even if it should be opened with a general text editor.
At the top left there are hints about the purpose and content of the settings file.
```
```
Underneath are the usual elements for settings: select, save, and manage. In the selection is
therefore the setting that is currently being edited. It is not possible to reduce the dialog.
Each setting contains different data sections, so-called "sections", depending on the file. In the
drop-list, the data area to be edited is selected.
Information about the purpose and content of the data area is displayed below for the current
data area. On the right there is a picture for further explanation.
```
```
The lower part of the dialog is taken by the actual editor. There, the content of the data area, ie
the data lines, is edited with usual functions. It is also possible to make incorrect entries that can
not be intercepted by the program. Therefore, only savvy users should edit these files.
Common editing functions are available here such as marking (with mouse), copying (Ctrl +
C), cutting (Ctrl + X) and pasting (Ctrl + V). Ctrl + Z takes a step back.
```

3.1.2.1 Data lines

Within the data area (section), each line consists of keyword - equals sign - value. After that, a comment
can follow separated by a double slash.

```
Kennwort = Wert
Kennwort = Wert // Kommentar
```
The possibilities and meanings for the keywords and values depend on the function that processes this
data. The corresponding instructions can be found in the descriptions that are displayed further up in the
dialog.

The comment is often used for given keywords for a definition of the keyword. For self-defined keywords
or user variables, the comment should also be used for a description, as it facilitates later processing
considerably.

## 3.2 Structure of editable settings files, editing in the general text editor

The editing of the files can also take place outside the program system in a standard text editor.
Changes are not automatically loaded in the project administration or in the building position. Therefore,
the following procedures are to be followed:

```
To edit the file, the calling function should be left in project administrarion or the building position.
When calling the function that uses the editable settings file, it is also reloaded.
Standard functions from Manage Settings are only to be used if the settings file is not opened in a
text editor.
Note: Unfortunately, it is not always possible to determine that a file is currently open, as e.g.
Notepad ++ automatically opens just a copy of the file.
```
Here are any incorrect entries possible that can not be intercepted by the program. The file can become
unusable. **Therefore, only savvy users should edit these files with a general text editor.**

**3.2.1 Structure and contents of editable settings files**

In editable settings files are structures and areas that can be changed in the editor and those that should
not be changed. Many of these files contain notes on the purpose and content of the file in corresponding
entries and comments.

If the text is a reference in the form # 123 (crossbar with number), then this is the reference to the line
number in Editdsi1.frg.

The files are divided into data sections called sections. Each section begins with an entry in square
brackets and ends with the same entry supplemented by the word **ENDSEC** :

```
[ SECTION NAME ]
...
[ SECTION NAME ENDSEC]
```
Within the section, each line consists of keyword - equals sign - value. After that, a comment can follow
separated by a double slash.

```
Kennwort = Wert
Kennwort = Wert // Kommentar
```
**3.2.2 Structure version of the file, [VERSION]**

Editability: Do not change!

The **VERSION** section contains the identifier for the structure version of the file. The program needs this
information to process the file correctly. This is not the version of their data. This section must not be
changed.


ExMPLE:

```
[VERSION]
Version=1.
[VERSION ENDSEC]
```
**3.2.3 Groups, [CATEGORY]**

Editability: Preferably, edit with _Manage Settings_.

The **CATEGORY** section contains the names and order of the groups. The keywords end with a number

that corresponds to the order. After the equal sign, the name of the group follows:

Example:

```
[CATEGORY]
CategoryName1= group abc
CategoryName2= group 123
[CATEGORY ENDSEC]
```
**3.2.4 File information,** [FILE INFO]

The section **FILE INFO** contains information about the file and the data defined in it. Here are valuable

hints about the data and rules in the file.

If the text is a reference in the form # 123 (crossbar with number), then this is the reference to the line
number in **Editdsi1.frg.** The texts from the frg (language file) are displayed in the dialog for editing
the editable settings files.

The keywords **FileDescription_1** to **FileDescription_5** can be assigned up to 5 lines of text..

Example:

```
[FILE INFO]
FileDescription_1= Beschreibung der Datei
FileDescription_2= max. 5 lines
FileDescription_ 3 = #
[FILE INFO ENDSEC]
```
**3.2.5 Section information, [SECTION INFORMATION]**

Editability: Information must be available for each section! Observe notes in the individual entries!

All settings of the file contain the same sections. System information is the same for all these sections,
regardless of their setting. Therefore, this information is recorded in this upstream section. Settings do
not have to contain all of these sections, but can only contain sections that have been defined here.

```
The SECTION INFORMATION section contains all the sections that can be used in the settings. For
each section there are information texts, the SectionsType and the reference
to a help picture:
Line1 .. Line5 Up to five lines of explanation text on the content of the section. Here are
valuable hints for editing the file. If the text is a reference in the form # 123
(crossbar with number), then this is the reference to the line number in
Editdsi1.frg. The texts from the frg (language file) are displayed in the
dialog for editing the editable settings files.
```
```
SectionType There are 3 types of sections : FILTER, FREE, FIX
```

```
FILTER The keyword in front of the equal sign describes a selection of
properties (wall, ceiling, roof surface) or a selection of item
numbers.
The following selection descriptions are possible:
ABC123 the whole name is ABC
ABC * the name starts with ABC
* ABC the name ends with ABC
* ABC * ABC is somewhere in the name.
```
```
Any number of entries can be made in this section. The parent
function determines if all applicable entries, only the first one or
only the last one is used.
FREE The keyword before the equal sign can be freely assigned. This
can e.g. be user variables.
Any number of entries can be made in this section.
FIX The keywords before the equals sign and their number are set. In
these sections, the possible keywords are already entered. No
further supplements can be added. Keywords that are not used
should simply stop with no assigned value.
```
```
ReferenceImagePath Reference to a help picture. This is displayed in the dialog for editing the
editable settings files.
```
Example:

### [SECTION INFORMATION]

### [ SECTION A ]

```
Line1=Text for section A
Line2=max. 5 lines
Line3=#
SectionType=FILTER
ReferenceImagePath=%DHPABB%\GWE___04.bmp
[ SECTION A ENDSEC]
```
```
[ SECTION B ]
..
[ SECTION B ENDSEC]
```
```
..
```
```
[SECTION INFORMATION ENDSEC]
```
**3.2.6 Settings [DATASET EDITDSI]**

The actual settings are defined in the sections **DATASET EDITDSI.**

```
▪ There is one such section for each shot. The section name is always the same, so it does not
contain a sequential number or the name of the setting.
▪ The display order of the settings corresponds to the order in the file.
```
### [DATASET EDITDSI]

### ...

### [DATASET EDITDSI ENDSEC]

### [DATASET EDITDSI]

### ...


### [DATASET EDITDSI ENDSEC]

Each of the settings first contains the information about the setting:

```
Name The name of the setting used to display it in select settings. The names of
the settings in a file must be unique, no name can be assigned twice.
CategoryName Group to which the setting belongs. Possible groups are listed in section
CATEGORY.
```
```
ReferenceImagePath Reference to a help picture. This is displayed in select settings and can be
very helpful to the operator.
```
```
The assignment of the help picture should be done in manage settings , since
the possible references in the paths are entered automatically here.
```
This is followed by the actual data _sections_. These were defined earlier in section **[SECTION
INFORMATION].**

The comment on the setting is recorded in the last _section_ in this setting: **[DATASET EDITDSI
MULTILINE_STRING]** With the keywords **Line1** to **Line5** up to 5 lines of comment text can be specified..
This is displayed in _select settings_ and can be very helpful to the operator. The comment can also be
entered in _Manage Settings_.

Example:

### [DATASET EDITDSI]

```
Name= Dataset one
CategoryName= group abc
ReferenceImagePath=%DHPABB%\DietrichsLogo.png
```
```
[ SECTION A ]
AW*=(WL<12.0[m]) //use double slash for commentary
[ SECTION A ENDSEC]
```
```
[ SECTION B ]
..
[ SECTION B ENDSEC]
```
```
..
```
```
[DATASET EDITDSI MULTILINE_STRING]
Line1= Text for setting Dataset one
Line2= max. 5 lines
[DATASET EDITDSI MULTILINE_STRING ENDSEC]
```
```
[DATASET EDITDSI ENDSEC]
```
**3.2.7 Data lines**

Within the data section, each line consists of keyword - equals sign - value. After that, a comment can
follow separated by a double slash.

```
Kennwort = Wert
Kennwort = Wert // Kommentar
```

The possibilities and meanings for the keywords and values depend on the function that processes this
data. The file contains corresponding notes in the sections **_[FILE INFO]_** and **_[SECTION INFORMATION]._**

The comment is often used for given keywords for a definition of the keyword. For self-defined keywords
or user variables, the comment should also be used for a description, as it facilitates later processing
considerably.
