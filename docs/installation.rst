   ported.

If you have any questions regarding the installation of the program we
will be happy to assist.

2 Default Mode
--------------

Dietrich’s Setup differentiates between **Default Installation** and
**User Defined Installation**. The user has no influence on a Default
Installation. It will install all necessary files and programs you need
for a Dietrich’s system with default path settings. The following will
describe the Default Mode in detail.

::

   The Default Mode is the recommended installation
   mode. The user may select the system language.
   This will define the language during installation and
   of the installed programs. In order to install, you
   have to accept the conditions of the license agree-
   ment.

2.1 Installation Mode
---------------------

Depending on the availability of previously installed versions, set-up
will deter- mine what installation mode to use. The modes are Update,
New and Parallel. Dietrich’s Versions are recognized by the Desktop
Icons that exist. Finding exist- ing Dietrich’s Versions may require
some time.

**New Installation:** This mode will be chosen if a new appropriate
Dietrich’s Version has been detected.

**Parallel Installation:** This mode is available if an immediate
preceding Ver- sion has been detected (e.g. a Version 19 has to be
installed in order to make a parallel installation of Version 20 ).

**Update Installation:** An existing version can be updated only with a
newer Version of the same Version number (e.g. an existing Version 20
.01 can be updated to Version 20 .02).

2.2 Taking Over Saved Settings
------------------------------

The new version comes with a variety of changes and enhancements in the
saved settings. During Update and Parallel Installation the following
message will appear:

If you continue selecting – YES – all you previously saved settings from
existing program versions will not be lost. You will be able to access
then in all program modules via ( 1 - 3 - 4) **> File > Templates, Work
Environments> load Work Environment <**. The work environment will show
the date you installed the program. You can find it under:
:raw-latex:`\Work `Environments:raw-latex:`\ENG` (see picture).

If you continue selecting – No – in order to keep working with your own
settings, you will still be able to access the new settings from every
program module via (1- 3 - 4) **> File > Templates, Work Environments>
Load Work Environment <**. You will find the new settings under:
:raw-latex:`\Work `Environments:raw-latex:`\ENG`:raw-latex:`\Update20`
23 .

2.3 Main Data Base
------------------

The installation mode set-up will determine what data base to use:

**New Installation:** During a New Installation the data base by default
will go to C::raw-latex:`\DHPDBA`. In addition, a back-up will go into a
sub di- rectory that shows the version number the d-base came from e.g.
’ENG 23 \_01’.

**Parallel Installation:** A Parallel Installation will use the same
d-base as the original Program Version. In addition, a back-up will go
into a sub directory that shows the version number the d-base came from
e.g. ’ENG 23 \_01’. All Program Versions that use the same path settings
for the d-base will be able to access it as well.

**Update Installation:** An Update Installation will use the existing
d-base. In addition, a back-up will go into a sub directory that shows
the version number the d-base came from e.g. ’ENG 23 \_01’. All Pro-
gram Versions that use the same path settings for the d-base will be
able to access it as well.

After successful completion, set-up will show a message window to
confirm that all files have been copied and registered.

2.4 License data
----------------

**D-Code Binding with Hardlock/D-Lock:**

::

   Binding means the further use of the previous protective plugs (Hardlock, D-
   Lock) for the current D-Code licensing system.
   If a new license has been initiated via sales, a ticket number is automatically
   generated.
   You will receive the ticket number e.g. by email.
   If the dialog for entering the ticket number does not open automatically when
   the program starts, the dialog can be called up in the Dietrich’s menu under 5
   settings - 5 D-code licenses - 1 Activate license ticket.

**D-Code Dongle:**

::

   New licenses are delivered with a D-Code dongle.
   A D-Code dongle acts as a protective plug and also includes the content of
   the license. After plugging in, the software is immediately ready for use and
   no further activation is necessary. If necessary, the license must still be se-
   lected via 5 Settings-5 D-Code Licenses-3 Select license to work.

3 User Defined Installation
---------------------------

::

   During a user defined installation you
   have the opportunity to make your own
   decisions what to install and where to
   install to. The available options are de-
   scribed in the following.

::

   The user may select the system lan-
   guage. This will define the language dur-
   ing installation and of the installed pro-
   grams. In order to install you have to ac-
   cept the conditions of the license agree-
   ment.

3.1 Language
------------

You can install the Dietrich’s Programs with mul- tiple languages.

You can switch between languages in Project Administration ‘5 Settings –
6 Language’.

.. _installation-mode-1:

3.2 Installation Mode
---------------------

Depending on the availability of previously installed versions, you will
be able to determine what installation mode to use. The modes are
Update, New and Paral- lel. Dietrich’s Versions are recognized by the
Desktop Icons that exist. Finding existing Dietrich’s Versions may
require some time.

Then you can select the installation mode you want to use:

**New Installation:** This option is always available. A new Dietrich’s
System will be built up from scratch, disregarding existing ver- sions.

**Parallel Installation:** This mode is available if an immediate
preceding Ver- sion has been detected (e.g. a Version 23 has to be
installed in order to make a parallel installation of Version 22 ). The
new ver- sion will go into a separate folder. You have to identify which
ex- isting version you want to take settings from.

**Update Installation:** An existing installation of a current version
(e.g. 23 .01) is required in order to update to a newer version (e.g. 23
.02). The existing version will be updated, existing settings remain un-
touched.

3.3 Taking Over Saved Settings
------------------------------

The new version comes with a variety of changes and enhancements in the
saved settings. During Update and Parallel Installation the following
message will appear:

If you continue selecting – YES – all you previously saved settings from
existing program versions will not be lost. You will be able to access
then in all program modules via (1- 3 - 4) **> File > Templates, Work
Environments> load Work Environment <**. The work environment will show
the date you installed the program. You can find it under:
:raw-latex:`\Work `Environments:raw-latex:`\ENG` (see picture).

If you continue selecting – No – in order to keep working with your own
settings, you will still be able to access the new settings from every
program module via (1- 3 - 4) **> File > Templates, Work Environments>
Load Work Environment <**. You will find the new settings under:
:raw-latex:`\Work `Environments:raw-latex:`\ENG`:raw-latex:`\Update20`
23 .

.. _main-data-base-1:

3.4 Main Data Base
------------------

Independent of installation mode you can decide whether to use an
existing d- base or if you want to take the new d-base from the DVD.

**Existing data base:** A browser will open and show the d-base you are
cur- rently using. You may change the path to a different d-base. In
addition a back-up will go into a sub directory that shows the ver- sion
number the d-base came from e.g. ’ENG 20 \_01’.

**New data base from DVD:** Set-up will suggest to put the d-base into
the de- fault folder C::raw-latex:`\DHPDBA`. You may select a different
destination path. In addition a back-up will go into a sub directory
that shows the version number the d-base came from e.g. ’ENG 23 \_01’.

In the next step you can define which existing versions are supposed to
use the same d-base. The Project Data Program of the selected versions
will be updated, so that they can handle the newer d-base format. We
suggest to work with the same d-base in all Program Versions.

After successful completion, set-up will show a message window to
confirm that all files have been copied and registered.

   no further activation is necessary. If necessary, the license must still be se-
   lected via 5 Settings-5 D-Code Licenses-3 Select license to work.

4 Automatic Data Synchronisation
--------------------------------

During installation, a current version of the d-base is put into a
folder next to the used d-base, which may be used to synchronize d-base
content.

(e.g. for Version 23 .01: \_C::raw-latex:`\DHPDBA`:raw-latex:`\ENG` 23
*01* )

**Requirements for an automatic data synch:**

If you kept an existing data base during installation, the first time
you start Pro- ject Administration the data base synchronization will
launch automatically.

You cannot override this step, but you may postpone it to a later point
in time.

**Back-up of the existing data base:**

Before the d-bases are synchronized, a back-up of the original d-base
will be made of the existing d-base and replace them with current values
from the new d-base.

(e.g. in Version 23 .01: \_C::raw-latex:`\DHPDBA`:raw-latex:`\ENG` 23
*01:raw-latex:`\Backup`\ YYYYMMDD\ ##* ).

**Auto Sync:** Auto sync will affect engineering values, connectors and
objects.

**Objects** : You can use the automatic or user defined synchronization.

Auto Sync will add new items, but will not overwrite existing ones.
During a user defined sync you can define what items you want to accept
and which ones may be replaced:

Properties like cost, visual representation, etc. will be shown for you
to make a decision. If you make no selection, the original values will
remain.
